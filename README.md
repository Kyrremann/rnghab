My contribution for the 2021 [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) game jam.
The theme this year was bug, and my game has a _bug_, instead of normal computer based [hand and brain chess](https://handandbrainchess.com/), where the computer tells which piece to move, it's now your turn to do it.
Good luck winning with this terrible randomized piece mover.
